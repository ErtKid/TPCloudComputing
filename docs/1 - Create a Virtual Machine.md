# Create a Virtual Machine (VM)

## Location - West US 2 (Zone 1)

I chose this location because it offers a variety of VM options at competitive costs, while being geographically advantageous for my needs.

## VM Size - Standard B2as v2 (2 vCPUs, 8 GB RAM)

This configuration provides a good balance between performance and cost for moderate workloads. It is sufficient for my applications without being overly expensive.

## Scheduled Auto-Shutdown

This feature is crucial for managing costs by shutting down the VM during periods of inactivity.

## Public IP Address and DNS

I assigned a public IP address and a DNS name to enable remote access and connectivity to the VM.
